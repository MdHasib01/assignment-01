        <h2>Marinated Vegetable Salad</h2>
        <small>Author: Md Hasib | 05 Jun 2021</small>
        <p class="p-txt">
            <strong>Marinated Vegetable Salad</strong> – let’s talk about it! How I’m loving the lettuce-less-ness of it. How it’s not only bright, beautiful, and colorful, but crazy-healthy too. How it’s make-ahead! Yep, chop all your favorite vegetables before going to bed then toss with a simple homemade vinaigrette, refrigerate, and serve the next day. <br> <br>

            <strong>How it’s sugar free.</strong> You know I love me a good sweet and savory combo but when it comes to fresh vegetables? I gotta go savory. Many marinated vegetable salad recipes call for tossing the vegetables in a dressing that includes equal parts sugar and vinegar, but I just can’t get down with sweet cauliflower when I know how delicious it can be tossed in a tart and snappy dressing instead!y dressing, herbs, and even fruit for maximum flavor. <br> <br>
            Now, I’ve chosen to highlight my favorite summer vegetables in this Marinated Vegetable Salad including cherry tomatoes, cucumber, cauliflower, carrots, and bell pepper, but you could swap in any vegetables you happen to love and/or have growing in your garden. Raw zucchini, summer squash, broccoli, sweet onion, celery, and/or corn would all make excellent additions to this easy dish. <br><br>

        <h2>Slaw Salad Recipes</h2>
        <small>Author: Md Hasib | 05 Jun 2021</small>
        <p class="p-txt">
            <strong>Salad recipes are my favorite</strong> way to showcase vibrant, in-season produce – fruits and veggies that are so good on their own that you don’t need to do much to make them into a delicious meal. On cold winter nights, I like to brighten up our dinner table with a big, colorful mix of root veggies and hearty greens. On beautiful, warm days when I’d rather be outside than in the kitchen, summer salads are the perfect solution: they’re simple to toss together, but they’re totally delicious nonetheless. <br><br>
            Whether you want to add more plant-based meals to your diet or are simply looking to change up your salad game, you’ll find tons of inspiration in the salad recipes below. With everything from green salads to pasta salads and beyond, these recipes are perfect for passing at potlucks, serving as dinner sides, and enjoying as full meals on their own. <br><br>
            <strong>Slaws are some of the best make-ahead salad recipes out there</strong> . Typically made with hearty vegetables like cabbage, kale, or broccoli, they’re sturdy enough to be dressed ahead of time. I like to accent the veggie base with a punchy dressing, herbs, and even fruit for maximum flavor. <br><br>
